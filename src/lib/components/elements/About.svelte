			Hey there! My name is <span class="font-bold text-primary">Ben // Fyxren</span>. I am a Smart
			Industry student and dabble as a hobbyist coder. Clocking in at 19 years old, I try to play
			the piano, enjoy watching anime and reading manga.
		</p>
		<p>
			Starting things is my jam, but the follow-through? Well, let's just say it's a rare sighting.
			Currently, my focus lies on creating websites, albeit often encountering more bugs than lines
			of code along the way.
		</p>
		<p>
			Truth be told, my life doesn't exactly qualify as a 'thrill ride', that was about it. Besides,
			if it slipped my mind, it's probably not worth losing sleep over, am I right?
